//If values are 0 search the 8 around it and return those values, if any of those values are 0
//repeat the logic until no 0's are found. 
//the 0's will break flags, isFlagged no functionality except visual
//if letter = a no left values, if number = 1 no value above
//hard code last values for 3 different boards
//just do beginner for now
//generate random values for bomb
//when bomb is pressed game is done and other bombs are revealed
//10 mines in a 9x9 board
//Logic for 8 around, it will be letter - 1, number -1, +0, +1, letter = same:number +1, -1
//letter + 1, number -1, +0, +1
//display the value of tile, check the value of 8 around, return the number of bombs
